# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository distributes unofficial patch builds for upstream OpenAI Codex. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.

Security reports should focus on:

- vulnerabilities introduced by patches in this repository
- release automation risks in this repository
- integrity issues with distributed binaries or checksums

Upstream Codex vulnerabilities should also be reported to upstream when appropriate.

## Reporting

For security-sensitive matters, contact the maintainer privately:

- GitHub: `@cowwoc`
- Email: `cowwoc2020@gmail.com`

Please include:

- affected upstream Codex version
- affected patched release version
- platform and architecture
- reproduction details
- impact assessment
- whether a public upstream issue already exists

## Response Policy

- The maintainer does not guarantee response times for unpaid reports.
- Security work with active issue funding or professional-services engagements receives priority.
- If the issue belongs upstream, the maintainer may decline to fix it here or may carry a temporary patch until upstream resolves it.

## Trust Model

- Patch files should stay small, auditable, and removable.
- Each patch directory should map to one repository-relative funded issue.
- Releases should publish checksums and identify the exact upstream commit and patch list used.

## Disclaimer

This file provides process guidance only. It is not legal advice, and the maintainer should review any security-response commitments with a lawyer before relying on them.
